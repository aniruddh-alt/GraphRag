# **GraphRag**  

GraphRag is a cutting-edge project that integrates graph-based knowledge representation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, providing a powerful system for exploring and explaining data relationships. This project leverages the Neo4j graph database to enhance natural language generation with a structured, explainable approach.

## **Features**  
- **Graph-Based Knowledge Representation**: Visualize and understand relationships between entities in a structured manner.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Incorporates knowledge retrieval to enhance generative AI outputs.  
- **Neo4j Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Neo4j graph database for efficient graph operations.  
- **Advanced NLP Capabilities**: Combines state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques for enhanced AI explainability.  

## **Installation**  
To get started with GraphRag, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/aniruddh-alt/GraphRag.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd GraphRag  
   ```  

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## **Why GraphRag?**  
GraphRag bridges the gap between structured graph representations and generative AI by making AI outputs more explainable. Through this project, you can:  
- Visualize relationships in research papers and other structured data.  
- Track how nodes and relationships contribute to the final prompt used in generative AI.  
- Enhance the transparency of AI models by providing insights into their knowledge retrieval and generation processes.  

## **Future Directions**  
GraphRag has immense potential for expanding its scope to:  
- Support larger knowledge graphs with multi-modal data.  
- Enable integration with other graph databases and AI frameworks.  
- Advance explainability for enterprise and academic use cases.
